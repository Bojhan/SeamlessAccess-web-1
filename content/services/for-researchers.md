That wiki you use to collaborate with other scientists around the world, the domain-specific app you share with others to do research, the articles you need to access that your institution has already paid for… It’s these things and more that drive the need for a single-sign on, federated identity service. SeamlessAccess exists to make this access easier by offering you an easy to find and easy to use button that will point you to your institution’s login page without having to jump through different hoops for every site and service you need to use.

Even if you have more than one institutional login, the choices are clear and simple, removing several hoops from between you and the material you need.

The Service Provider (SP) offering the services or content you require do not see your username or password; the only information stored (and it’s stored only in your browser) is your previous choice of Identity Provider (IdP). 

You can opt out of this service entirely by disabling cookies in your browser.

###SeamlessAccess for Research Collaborations
Federated Identity Management (FIM) is a priority for many research collaborations. SeamlessAccess allows these collaborations to use a common, configurable, and community-supported identity discovery service that will help make single sign-on easier for their researchers.SeamlessAccess.org enables fast and easy access to FIM-enabled services, including wikis, web sites, and other collaboration tools. 

Research collaborations have a unique role in the context of FIM: they often serve as both an Identity Provider (IdP) for participating researchers that do not have an account at an institution that supports FIM, and as a Service Provider (SP) for collaboration-specific services such as wikis and domain-specific tools for their participants. Any identity discovery and persistence service needs to be able to take into account both the collaboration-hosted IdP as well as any institutional IdPs that the collaboration has federated with. SeamlessAccess.org can be configured to support that model.

See “SeamlessAccess for Identity Providers” and “SeamlessAccess for Service Providers” for more detail.
