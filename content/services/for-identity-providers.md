# SeamlessAccess for Identity Providers

Participation in an identity federation is required to implement SeamlessAccess. An institution must have an Identity Provider (IdP) service, and is ultimately responsible for allowing or restricting any information (such as attributes) to be shared about their user communities. Organizations may want to consider implementing a service such as [Consent-informed Attribute Release](https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/CAR/CAR%3A+Consent-informed+Attribute+Release+system) (CAR), a service that is out of scope for SeamlessAccess itself, but which will allow IdPs to put control of information sharing in the hands of their users. 

SeamlessAccess streamlines an organizationâ€™s existing federated identity environment by making it possible for users to stay logged in across different resource providers (single sign-on).
