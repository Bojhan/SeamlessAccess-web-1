Federation Operators will find SeamlessAccess.org a powerful tool - it supports that key step in federated single sign-on is for a user to “find home”, i.e., to indicate which institution’s credential she wishes to sign in with. Federation Operators can offer a branded default identity provider discovery service to their members that will allow users to see the value the federation brings to the experience.

Today, services implement their own home-finding, or discovery, mechanisms with different vocabulary and user interface. This results in highly inconsistent experience, making it difficult for casual users to navigate the sign-in experience. SeamlessAccess provides a consistent, intuitive and easy-to-use home institution discovery mechanism. It dramatically simplifies the sign in experience.
 
Further, with appropriately branding, this discovery mechanism visually conveys to the user that they are signing into the service with the same trusted credential issued by their home institution, underpinned by a globally trusted research and education community. It lends a powerful platform to help the end user intuit the value of R&E identity federations.
