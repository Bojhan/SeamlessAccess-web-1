# SeamlessAccess is a service

designed to help foster a more streamlined online access experience when using scholarly collaboration tools, information resources, and shared research infrastructure. The service promotes digital authentication leveraging an existing single sign-on infrastructure through one's home institution, while maintaining an environment that protects personal data and privacy.

SeamlessAccess aims to enable simple, trusted use of scholarly resources and services anytime, anywhere, and on any device.

**_SeamlessAccess is being run as a beta service in a high availability environment. Services are expected to change as we gain experience and feedback from the community._**
