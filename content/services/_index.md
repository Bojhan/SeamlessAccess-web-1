# SeamlessAccess is free
but there are some Terms of Service a Service Provider will need to agree to in order to use SeamlessAccess.

**_The functionality of SeamlessAccess in a beta service; services are expected to change as we gain experience and feedback from the community. The availability of the service is a full production, highly available environment._**
