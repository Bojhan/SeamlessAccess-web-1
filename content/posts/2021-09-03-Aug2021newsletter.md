# The SeamlessAccess Product Roadmap
Work on SeamlessAccess is an ever-evolving set of activities. Over the next few months, we expect several features to be released, including progressive scrolling on the Standard IdP discovery page and various internationalization improvements. Much of our planning and development work is focused on improving how we signal to a user that a given IdP is more or less likely to work with a given service provider. The roadmap is now available on our [website](https://seamlessaccess.org/services/) and will be updated regularly. 


# Staff Change
As of July 1st, Hylke Koers has taken over the baton from Heather Flanagan as SeamlessAccess’ Program Director. Hylke recently joined the STM Association as CIO for it’s new [STM Solutions](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/04/02/introducing-stm-solutions-an-interview-with-hylke-koers-and-ian-moss/.) initiative, which has access as one of its priorities. Hylke is excited to be part of SeamlessAccess and looks forward to working with the SeamlessAccess community and helping shape its future direction.

Heather Flanagan will continue to stay involved as Technical Liaison, working on an optimal coordination and collaboration between SeamlessAccess and relevant other community groups as well as contributing to the more technically-focused Working Groups.

Eefke Smit, Director S&T of STM and one of the long-term sponsors of SeamlessAccess, says:

_"Heather came as a gift from heaven to the project - a woman with exactly the right expertise, the right network and a well-fitting skill set. She took a key role in developing it from RA21 (Resource Access in the 21st Century) into SeamlessAccess.org. This was now 5 years ago. The rest is history – our gratitude for her contributions live on. Her new role will be equally valuable for the future of the project, with SeamlessAccess now ready to go operational."_
